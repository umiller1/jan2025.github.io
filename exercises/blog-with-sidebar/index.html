                            It was a sunny afternoon in Konoha, and 
                            the village was abuzz with excitement—it 
                            was Himawari Uzumaki’s birthday. Balloons 
                            floated, confetti flew, and Iruka-sensei 
                            was somehow in charge of the bouncy castle
                            logistics.

                                Somewhere a few rooftops over, Tenten 
                                limped down the street, muttering curses 
                                under her breath and clutching a bag of 
                                ice to her cheek. Why? Because earlier 
                                that day, she’d decided it was a great 
                                idea to ask Temari if she was "still just 
                                Gaara’s sister or finally Shikamaru’s 
                                wife-slash-problem." Temari smiled. Then 
                                she hit her with a fan gust so hard, 
                                Tenten landed in the weapons shop window 
                                and still had time to regret her entire 
                                bloodline.

                        <p>
                            As she hobbled past Ichiraku’s Rooftop 
                            Ramen Hideout, something caught her eye.
                            <blockquote>
                                Naruto.<br>
                                And Sasuke.<br>
                                Sitting way too close.<br>
                                Sharing mochi like this was a romantic filler episode.
                            </blockquote>
                            Tenten squinted. “…Isn’t today Himawari’s 
                            birthday?” She looked harder. Naruto fed 
                            Sasuke a bite of ramen. Sasuke didn’t stab 
                            him. Confirmed: Scandal. Tenten 
                            immediately took out her phone and snapped
                            a picture with the flash on by accident. 
                            Naruto turned in horror. Tenten, holding 
                            the ice pack and bleeding a little, just 
                            yelled from the alleyway: "YOU’RE GOING TO 
                            HELL, HOKAGE SCAMMER. TELL HINATA I’M ON 
                            HER SIDE." Then she slipped on a takoyaki 
                            tray and disappeared into a dumpster.
