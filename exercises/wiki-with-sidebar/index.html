                <p>
                    The Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) or Canadian lynx
                    is one of the four living species in the genus 
                    Lynx. It is a medium-sized wild cat characterized 
                    by long, dense fur, triangular ears with black 
                    tufts at the tips, and broad, snowshoe-like paws. 
                    Its hindlimbs are longer than the forelimbs, so 
                    its back slopes downward to the front. The Canada 
                    lynx stands 48–56 cm (19–22 in) tall at the 
                    shoulder and weighs between 5 and 17 kg (11 and 
                    37 lb). It is a good swimmer and an agile climber.

                    The scientific name Felis lynx canadensis was 
                    proposed by Robert Kerr in 1792 who described a 
                    lynx from Canada.[3] In the late 19th century, 
                    several lynx zoological specimens were described:

                        Lynx subsolanus was proposed by Outram Bangs 
                        in 1897 for a lynx skin and skull collected 
                        near Codroy, Newfoundland.

                    <li>
                        Lynx canadensis mollipilosus was proposed by 
                        Witmer Stone in 1900 who described a skull and 
                        a dark brown skin of a male lynx killed near 
                        Wainwright, Alaska
                    </li>
